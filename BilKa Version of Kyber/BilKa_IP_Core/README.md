Slow-running functions were found in the Kyber algorithm with the analyzes obtained as a result of the profiling. Therefore, we predict that the Kyber algorithm will be 
accelerated thanks to the hardware design of the function with the most used operations in slow-running functions. We used Xilinx Vitis High-Level Synthesis 2019.2 to 
create the hardware design. Here you can find the C code we wrote to create hardware design in HLS and the custom SoC accelerator module we designed.
