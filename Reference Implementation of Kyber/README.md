# Reference Implementation of Kyber

The code taken from https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber was run on ZedBoard to implement the SoC architecture and design the accelerator. PetaLinux, an embedded linux solution, was used to run functions containing the OpenSSL library. The design and innovations made can be found in the BilKa version.
